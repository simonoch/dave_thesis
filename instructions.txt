Put some instructions in here.
You will have to do the spacing
and line split yourself.
<blank>
You can add empty lines in the
middle by putting <blank> on a
line by itself. For some reason
known only to it's creator, PEBL
appears to throw away real blank

lines.
<blank>
If the very first line of the file
is <centretext> the text for will
be centred instead of left
justified - like this page is.
Enjoy.
