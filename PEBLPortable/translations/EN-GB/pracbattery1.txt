Now you will practice doing both parts of the task at the
same time.

In the next practice set, you will be given a maths problem.
Once you make your decision about the problem,a letter will
appear on the screen. Try and remember the letter.

In the previous section where you only did the maths problems,
the computer computed your average time to solve the problems.
If you take longer than your average time, the computer will
automatically move you onto the next letter part, thus skipping
the True or False part and will count that problem as a maths
error. Therefore it is VERY important to solve the problems as
quickly and as accurately as possible.
