That is the end of the practice.
The real task will look like the practice trials you
just completed. First you will get a maths problem to solve,
then a letter to remember.

When you see the recall screen, select the letters in
the order presented. If you forget a letter, click the
BLANK box to mark where it should go.

Some of the sets will have more maths problems and letters
than others.
It is important that you do your best on both the maths
problems and the letter recall parts of this experiment.
<blank>
Remember for the maths problems you must work as QUICKLY and
ACCURATELY as possible. Also, remember to keep your maths
problem accuracy at 85% or above.
